A simple Cashier / kiosk system for a specific Resturant that am affiliated with.
Still in progress and still will be


**Scope:**
  - Dashboard page to see the orders compiled its total sales and total income.
  - Receipt page to see/add records and illiminate hand-written documentation.
  - Record receipts with build in offline database.
  - Simple UI for fast interactions.
  - Sample idea of the app formula.
  - Offline application which doesn't required internet connection (unless manager wants to implement a cloud database).
  Example formulas:
```
  function Compute additional total:
    Item_Name1 * Item_value1 = Item_Total1
    Item_Name2 * Item_value2 = Item_Total2
    **Item_Total1 + Item_Total2 = TotalProductValue**

  function Change exchange:
    User_Money - TotalProductValue = Customer_Change
```

**Future Scope:**
  - allow to print excel or csv files
  - 


**What does it do?**
Its goal is to simplify computing problems during transaction phase in the resturant, and also record reciepts in the process.

**What environment is it?**
Its made in the flutter environment and has an offline database so it doesn't need internet connection

**Will this help me, the one whos reading this?**
Actually.... **no** but its a good start up foundation for an easy offline receipt/kiosk system for especific resturants, and over-time ill update it, its basically just a hobby project for me to learn more about flutter and C++.
